# Coursera Data Science Capstone

### Coursera and SwiftKey Project 
This repository is about the Capstone Project of the Coursera Data Science Specialization.

SwiftKey is the company that works in cooperation with Professors of the Johns Hopkins University to prepare this Project, with objective to construct a predictive model that makes easier for people to type on their mobile devices.

The goal is to take a dataset provided and create an NLP (natural language processing) model that is able to predict subsequent words.
